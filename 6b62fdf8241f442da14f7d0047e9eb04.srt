1
00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.004
- While many people will use the ChatGPT service

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.003
directly on the web or through its own app,

3
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:09.009
its backend large language model, or LMM,

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.006
is a software platform that enables all types

5
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.006
of innovation to be built on top of it.

6
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:18.001
By this I mean that GPT technology

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.000
can be incorporated seamlessly into existing solutions

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.003
via application programming interfaces, or APIs,

9
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:28.009
software that enables two or more computer programs

10
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.005
to communicate with each other.

11
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:36.005
GPT could also be the basis for completely new innovation.

12
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.005
For example, Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI,

13
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.005
is quickly building GPT capabilities

14
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.009
into many of its products,

15
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.009
including its popular Office suite

16
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.006
and its search tool Bing.

17
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:53.004
Under the moniker Microsoft 365 Copilot,

18
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.003
these GPT-based functions will enhance

19
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:58.008
and simplify existing capability

20
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:02.000
and also add completely new features.

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.006
For example, in Outlook,

22
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:06.002
a user will be able to get a summary of emails

23
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:09.002
in a long thread rather than having to read through

24
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.003
all of them.

25
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.005
As an example of new innovation,

26
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.009
a service called Be My Eyes

27
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.003
that has typically used human volunteers

28
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.009
to describe images to visually impaired people

29
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.007
is beginning to use GPT to automatically process visuals

30
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:29.007
and then describe them without any human intervention.

31
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:33.008
Further still, this new GPT-powered version enables a user

32
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:38.002
to ask AI questions about what is in the image.

33
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.006
A variation of this supports the ability

34
00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:44.005
for a person to take a picture of the contents of a fridge

35
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.005
and then ask GPT to suggest recipes

36
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:52.004
that would use the ingredients it can see in the image.

37
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:54.006
This capability can also be used

38
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:56.003
to translate written language

39
00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.006
by simply taking a photo of, say,

40
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:01.002
a food product from a foreign country

41
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.006
and having GPT process the text

42
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:07.007
and produce output in the language of choice.

43
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.000
The popular online

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and free educational service from Khan Academy

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.003
has being quick to adopt GPT capabilities.

46
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.009
They use AI as a teaching aid to help students arrive

47
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.002
at the correct answer to a question

48
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.007
or to better grasp a complex topic.

49
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:28.005
For example, an area they're developing is the ability

50
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:32.006
to interview historical figures such as Cleopatra.

51
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.005
Imagine that.

52
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.008
For teachers, AI is helping to create lesson plans

53
00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:41.003
and assisting with administrative tasks.

54
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:42.009
For developing software,

55
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.009
GPT is having a profound impact.

56
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:50.007
Existing developers can paste problematic code into ChatGPT

57
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:54.006
and it will find the bug and suggest the remedy.

58
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.000
Code can also be generated

59
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.001
in the programming language of choice

60
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.002
simply with a plain language prompt.

61
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:06.001
Creating a complex SQL query becomes a breeze.

62
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:07.005
Even more remarkably,

63
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:10.002
a picture drawn of a desired app screen

64
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.009
or a simple text description can be processed

65
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:16.002
into the code for a basic functioning app.

66
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.006
Additional features including elaborate

67
00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:20.008
graphical user interface design

68
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:23.006
is simply a few prompts away.

69
00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:27.003
Once the domain of experienced developers and designers,

70
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:28.008
because of GPT,

71
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:31.004
writing code or no code development

72
00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:34.006
is becoming far more accessible.

73
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:37.004
GPT can help to process a wide variety

74
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:39.003
of business-related requests,

75
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.009
including the generation of ideas,

76
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.006
image creation, reports,

77
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:47.003
math calculations, presentations,

78
00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:51.009
stories and scripts, curated lists, emails,

79
00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.008
and content summaries and explainers.

80
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:58.009
It can also simplify complex text, do translations,

81
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.000
compare and contrast items,

82
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.009
and conduct research.

83
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.009
Requests can be combined where, for example,

84
00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.006
GPT can be asked in one prompt to search

85
00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:12.004
and find information, simplify it,

86
00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:13.009
and present it in text

87
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.004
or visual form in the style of your choice.

88
00:04:17.004 --> 00:04:20.007
One solution called AutoGPT

89
00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:24.002
when only given a goal instead of explicit requests

90
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:27.000
will create the relevant tasks to achieve that goal

91
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.008
and then execute them.

92
00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:32.005
Watching the software determine the right tasks,

93
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:35.002
sometimes changing its mind based on results,

94
00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:40.002
and then creating a new task is magical to watch.

95
00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:42.004
Finally, an area that is being transformed

96
00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:45.001
by GPT is customer service,

97
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:48.000
historically a human-intensive exercise.

98
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.004
Attempts to automate the response to questions, requests,

99
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:54.006
and complaints has only been marginally successful

100
00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:56.004
in the past few decades.

101
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.006
More often than not,

102
00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:59.003
customers get frustrated

103
00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:01.007
and have to speak to a human.

104
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:04.003
Now with GPT-powered AI,

105
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:08.001
customer service may finally be ready for prime time.

106
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:10.004
Conversations are human-like,

107
00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:13.003
responses are accurate and intelligent,

108
00:05:13.003 --> 00:05:17.000
and video and voice can be incorporated.

109
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.009
It won't be long before customer service

110
00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.006
with AI is commonplace,

111
00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:23.007
and it may even be preferable in many instances

112
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:26.005
to working with a human.

113
00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:30.007
A challenge in providing examples of GPT in practice

114
00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:36.000
is the speed at which new AI-driven innovation is emerging.

115
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.009
While my examples in this video give you a flavor

116
00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.003
of the many ways GPT is being used,

117
00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:43.007
by the time you watch this,

118
00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:48.004
there will be many more incredible solutions available.

119
00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:50.003
After you watch this video,

120
00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:53.008
ask ChatGPT to tell you all about them.
