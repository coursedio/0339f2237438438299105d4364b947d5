00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Presenter] In November, 2022,

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:06.002
in what we may look back as a pivotal moment in history,

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:10.004
OpenAI released ChatGPT and made it available for free

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.006
to anyone who signed up.

5
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.006
Overnight, millions could use this generative AI tool,

6
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:20.002
a type of sophisticated chatbot, to get detailed answers

7
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:24.008
to questions and generate new content.

8
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.004
Up until this point, OpenAI products

9
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:31.000
including prior versions of GPT were only accessible

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.003
to certain users such as developers and academics,

11
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.006
and often, for a fee.

12
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:39.009
By releasing ChatGPT for everyone at no cost,

13
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:44.006
for the first time, high-end AI became broadly accessible.

14
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.009
In fact, within two months of its public launch,

15
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:52.006
ChatGPT had 100 million users, breaking the world record

16
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:57.002
to become the fastest-growing web application ever.

17
00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.009
By simply entering a plain language prompt,

18
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.008
users discovered they could quickly have ChatGPT,

19
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:07.003
for example, create essays, write software code,

20
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:10.005
develop resumes, compose emails,

21
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.007
and summarize content.

22
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:16.002
This was generative AI at work.

23
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.004
For the free version, OpenAI based ChatGPT

24
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.007
on version 3.5 of GPT.

25
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:24.006
While the public gets all the benefits

26
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:28.006
from having free access, OpenAI is motivated by the upside

27
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:32.004
of having millions of people participate in GPT research

28
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.007
as well as the feedback process.

29
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:39.002
A premium version of ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus

30
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.004
was released in early 2023

31
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:45.008
and uses the more sophisticated GPT-4 version.

32
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.007
In addition to being more accurate

33
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:50.003
and capable than the free version,

34
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:54.000
ChatGPT Plus also has faster response times,

35
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.009
better capacity management,

36
00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.002
and provides earlier access to new features.

37
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.006
What may surprise many is that leaps in the quality

38
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:06.006
of output in recent versions of GPT and ChatGPT

39
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:10.005
are being helped as a result of human trainers.

40
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:16.008
Called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, or RLHF,

41
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:19.006
GPT is provided with feedback by a person

42
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:23.000
on generated output, and this feedback is then incorporated

43
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.006
back into the large language model.

44
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.005
This cycle of output and feedback

45
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.007
rapidly improves the model.

46
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.008
At the heart of ChatGPT are input prompts.

47
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:36.002
The quality of output is a direct result

48
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.008
of well-constructed prompts.

49
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:42.007
Crafting prompts is referred to as prompt engineering.

50
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.000
It wouldn't be my first choice for a term

51
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that easily rolls off the tongue, but nevertheless,

52
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.001
it appears to have stuck.

53
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:53.004
Remember, a prompt isn't simply a question similar

54
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:56.007
to what we've become accustomed to with search engines.

55
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.005
Of course, ChatGPT handles questions well,

56
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:01.003
providing one answer rather than links

57
00:03:01.003 --> 00:03:03.008
to thousands of possible results.

58
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:05.009
It has far more elaborate capabilities

59
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.005
that include sorting and classifying information,

60
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.001
creating software code and generating,

61
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:16.008
rewriting, summarizing, and expanding text.

62
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.001
To get the most from ChatGPT, it requires both a period

63
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:23.007
of experimentation and also good technique.

64
00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:26.004
It's okay, for instance, to keep rewriting your request

65
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:29.008
until you get an output closer to what you want.

66
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:34.005
Each time a response is given by ChatGPT, it's different.

67
00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:37.003
Also, given that ChatGPT retains awareness

68
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.007
of everything captured in a single conversation session

69
00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:42.003
means it will use those insights

70
00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:44.009
to inform its output for you.

71
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.006
For now though, once you close the window or app,

72
00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:50.002
that memory is lost.

73
00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:52.005
When crafting a prompt, you can use commands

74
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:55.001
to begin your sentence, such as write,

75
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.008
summarize, translate, and create.

76
00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:00.007
Add context to your request.

77
00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.008
For example, you could prompt,

78
00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:06.007
"What are good gym exercises for a 30-minute workout?"

79
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:09.001
However, you might add prior to that,

80
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.007
"I want to build muscle in my arms."

81
00:04:11.007 --> 00:04:14.002
Then follow it with your questions.

82
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:17.000
It works well, too, to add identity.

83
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.002
For example, in the gym example,

84
00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:21.003
you might add, "Provide the exercises

85
00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:24.000
for a male between the ages of 30 and 40."

86
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.002
This works for all manner of prompts.

87
00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:28.004
You could ask ChatGPT to write an email

88
00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:30.005
that comes from a boss to an employee

89
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:32.007
or from an employee to a boss.

90
00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:37.008
ChatGPT loves specificity and descriptions.

91
00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:41.000
It also benefits from providing examples in the prompt.

92
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
For instance, "I enjoy The Beatles

93
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.001
and The Rolling Stones.

94
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:48.004
Suggest bands with similar styles."

95
00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:51.003
You'll find a lot of help creating prompts online.

96
00:04:51.003 --> 00:04:53.002
Here are three sites to give you a flavor

97
00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:55.000
of what's available.

98
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.003
Here's PromptBase.

99
00:04:56.003 --> 00:04:58.005
This is a solution that provides a database

100
00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:01.002
of effective prompts that gets results

101
00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:04.003
in a wide number of generative AI tools,

102
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:09.007
such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.

103
00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.001
Next, Vellum.

104
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:13.006
This is a site, which is a suite of tools

105
00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:15.005
in support of LLMs.

106
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:20.006
It includes features that help with prompt engineering.

107
00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:23.007
Finally, FusionAI is a support tool

108
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:25.003
that will generate prompts

109
00:05:25.003 --> 00:05:27.004
based on what you're trying to achieve.

110
00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:31.007
It will iterate with you until you get the desired output.

111
00:05:31.007 --> 00:05:34.001
ChatGPT is impressive and powerful,

112
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.000
but it's certainly not perfect.

113
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.005
It's still early in its development.

114
00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:41.001
You'll find that it sometimes can't answer your prompt

115
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:45.000
including having no knowledge after September, 2021

116
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.008
because that data is not included

117
00:05:46.008 --> 00:05:49.002
in its large language model.

118
00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:53.000
I suspect that this limitation will disappear soon though.

119
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.007
ChatGPT may also give an answer it simply makes up.

120
00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:59.009
We call this an AI hallucination.

121
00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.004
Open AI's use policy also prohibits certain uses.

122
00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:07.009
While ChatGPT is one app that runs in GPT,

123
00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.008
there are many more.

124
00:06:09.008 --> 00:06:13.009
Next, we'll explore some of those other applications of GPT.
