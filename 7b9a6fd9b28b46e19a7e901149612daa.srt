1
00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.002
- As each day passes, greater numbers of organizations

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.008
are adopting artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:10.006
They're incorporating it into their products and services,

4
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.002
building new solutions and reinventing existing ones.

5
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.004
And they're using it to run better operations.

6
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:21.003
Soon, AI in an enterprise will be as ubiquitous

7
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:26.003
and as important as connectivity and electricity.

8
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:29.001
Being successful with AI, like a lot of major

9
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.008
industrial scale innovation over the years

10
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:35.004
will require thoughtful and strategic moves.

11
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.000
It will demand some tough decisions, such as dropping

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.009
or reinventing some products and services,

13
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.002
taking on new revenue opportunities

14
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.001
and reshaping the workforce.

15
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:51.004
The AI supported enterprise will require retooling employees

16
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:54.005
and perhaps even reducing staff.

17
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.001
Let's take a look at a few of the early actions

18
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.006
that businesses may want to identify

19
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:02.008
as a plan for an AI future.

20
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.007
As a priority at the leadership and management level,

21
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:10.005
it's important to have a vision for AI in the organization.

22
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.005
It should be clear on what problems AI will solve

23
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.005
or new opportunities that it will present.

24
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:19.009
That vision will be translated to a strategy,

25
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.001
a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats

26
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.008
or SWOT analysis, will add value here.

27
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:30.003
The risks of doing both, nothing and something

28
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.005
must also both be evaluated.

29
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.005
Developing a vision and strategy

30
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:39.009
and conducting both a SWOT analysis and risk assessment

31
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.008
will require acquiring knowledge

32
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:44.007
on what's currently possible, and even some predictions

33
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.008
and bets on where AI is headed.

34
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:52.002
Leaders should attain a good understanding of AI providers,

35
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.000
the solutions they are shipping

36
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.004
and their future product and service roadmaps.

37
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:00.000
They should also closely monitor their competitors

38
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.003
and deeply engage their own customers on expectations.

39
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.004
Management must also be prepared

40
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.007
to take some additional investment risks

41
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:13.005
and be open to experimenting.

42
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.007
Fostering a culture of innovation is essential.

43
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:21.000
Research published in the Harvard Business Review

44
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.003
claimed that early adopters of innovation

45
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:27.004
using digital technologies, are growing twice as fast

46
00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:31.001
as those who are technologically conservative.

47
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.008
For many organizations, short-term plans for AI

48
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:35.008
are going to be primarily focused

49
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:40.009
on acquiring or upgrading existing tools with integrated AI.

50
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:44.003
Applications that are delivered via software as a service

51
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.009
or SaaS, will simply see the capability

52
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.009
as it's made available.

53
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:53.000
In the medium term, companies will acquire new,

54
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.007
AI centric tools for all manner of augmentation

55
00:02:56.007 --> 00:03:01.006
and automation capability, including forecasting, design,

56
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:05.005
customer service, content generation, and more.

57
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:08.006
This will be a time for developing an organization's

58
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:11.007
AI standards and principles.

59
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:15.009
In the long term, AI will necessitate many organizations

60
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:21.002
to completely reinvent themselves in order to survive.

61
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.000
Leadership and staff training

62
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.003
in a rapidly changing world of digital transformation

63
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:28.008
is more important than ever.

64
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:32.004
With AI, a training must be a high priority.

65
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:35.002
Knowing how to tap into these new AI functions

66
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:40.002
and leverage their value will enhance employee performance.

67
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:42.000
For a growing number of businesses,

68
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.003
there will be enthusiasm to build their own

69
00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:46.003
AI powered solutions.

70
00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:49.003
It's a more complex and riskier route,

71
00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:50.007
but with plenty of upside,

72
00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:54.002
including attaining competitive advantage.

73
00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:56.009
Depending on an organization's complexity

74
00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.000
and degree of engagement with AI systems,

75
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.006
it will need to consider retooling and hiring talent.

76
00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:08.001
Roles will include those with AI skills and experience

77
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:10.007
such as project managers, analysts,

78
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:14.005
programmers in a variety of languages, architects,

79
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:18.007
data scientists, and perhaps even in prompt engineering.

80
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:23.008
The ability to construct high quality GPT inputs.

81
00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:26.006
Preparing your organization for the challenges

82
00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:29.000
and opportunities of the 21st century

83
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.004
means being in a forward-leaning position.

84
00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:36.009
It will require bolder choices, greater risks,

85
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.004
in certain investments, and a culture of innovation.

86
00:04:41.004 --> 00:04:45.000
And the bottom line, it'll all be for nothing

87
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.003
if you don't have the right skills available.
