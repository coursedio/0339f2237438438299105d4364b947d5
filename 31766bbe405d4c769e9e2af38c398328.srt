00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.009
- [Host] Today, AI is being used across all industries

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:08.000
and has many uses including fraud detection, search,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.003
autonomous driving, spam filtering, recommendation engines

4
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.002
and facial recognition.

5
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.002
These and others belong to a variety

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:20.002
of categories and types within the AI domain.

7
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:24.009
GPT belongs to an AI category called Generative AI.

8
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.008
Other technologies and vendors are also in this category

9
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.005
including those being developed

10
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:35.003
and deployed from Google, Alibaba, Meta and Nvidia.

11
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:38.005
While I may occasionally allude to these other companies

12
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.008
in this course, we're particularly focusing

13
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:45.009
on GPT, a product of the Open AI organization.

14
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.002
So what exactly is generative AI?

15
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:52.001
Simply stated, generative AI is a way

16
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.003
for software to create new content based

17
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.002
on a user providing a prompt.

18
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.006
For example, a prompt such as draw a picture

19
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.001
of a mountain covered in snow would result in the output

20
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:09.000
of a unique never before seen AI generated image.

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.009
Prompts include questions, suggestions

22
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.000
or narratives that are created in plain language

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.003
by a user as an input,

24
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.000
in response to a prompt generative AI applications

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.009
then spit out new content in the form of text, images,

26
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:30.000
audio, animation, software code, and more.

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Given the recent buzz around generative AI,

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.001
it may seem that it's a completely new category of AI.

29
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.009
In fact, generative AI was first introduced in the 1960s,

30
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.006
in basic computer chatbots,

31
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:47.000
so-called conversation simulators.

32
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.004
Significant progress was made in the early 2010s

33
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.009
with the emergence of GANs

34
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.008
or Generative Adversarial Networks,

35
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.000
technology that enables the creation of images,

36
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.004
video, and audio that appear to be authentic.

37
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.004
I won't go deeper on GANs in this course

38
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:08.004
but it's an area I recommend you explore

39
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:11.008
depending on how technical you want to get.

40
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:15.003
Generative AI, like a lot of categories within AI,

41
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.008
also owes its success to neural networks.

42
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:22.003
In simple terms, a neural network is software designed

43
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:25.008
to learn from finding patterns in datasets.

44
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:29.001
While the first neural nets first appeared as early

45
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:33.004
as the 1950s, it wasn't until the emergence of large volumes

46
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:37.007
of data and high performance computing in the early-2000s

47
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:40.007
that content generation became practical.

48
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:42.008
Additional progress was made through the use

49
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:45.000
of neural net parallel processing

50
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.008
on graphical processing units or GPUs,

51
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:51.008
and advances in software including GANs,

52
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:56.007
large language models, or LLMs and transformers.

53
00:02:56.007 --> 00:03:02.001
I briefly discuss LLMs and transformers in the next video.

54
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:03.009
Acknowledging that the capabilities

55
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.005
of generative AI are emerging rapidly,

56
00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:09.001
today the most common use include image

57
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.007
and video creation, text generation, and audio output.

58
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:16.002
In many instances, the new content is often

59
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:20.000
indistinguishable from real things or impossible to tell,

60
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.002
they were not created by a person.

61
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:26.002
For example, these pictures of human faces aren't real.

62
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:30.003
These people don't actually exist.

63
00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:33.005
Clearly, generative AI has a lot of us excited

64
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:37.002
by its potential to transform many aspects of how we work

65
00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:41.009
and live, areas that I explore in a later video.

66
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.006
But it also raises many questions and implications

67
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:49.001
in the realm of socioeconomics, ethics, legality

68
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.002
and a whole lot more.

69
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:52.003
Before proceeding,

70
00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:55.000
take a few minutes to consider how generative AI

71
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.008
might impact your job organization or industry.
