00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.004
- [Instructor] Version four of GPT is remarkable

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.004
in all that it can do today.

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.004
It has come a long way since prior versions.

4
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.007
Improvements include significantly better

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.006
accuracy and reasoning,

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.002
images as inputs,

7
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.007
and support for much larger text prompts.

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.005
However, even version four

9
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.002
has some clear limitations to overcome.

10
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.009
That said, let's recognize that

11
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.003
while these limitations exist today,

12
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:29.007
subsequent versions of GPT and its competitors

13
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.009
have a high probability of overcoming these.

14
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.008
In fact, this may happen sooner than many of us think.

15
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:38.007
In this video, I'll touch on a few

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:43.002
of the most obvious limitations of GPT-4.

17
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.003
Sometimes when working with GPT, the quality of the content

18
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:50.003
can make it seem that authentic thinking is happening.

19
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.008
That is, the software is generating creative,

20
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:55.009
original thought, and then producing the output.

21
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:57.009
GPT doesn't understand

22
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.003
and process prompts in the human sense.

23
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:06.000
In reality, GPT is smartly regurgitating existing data

24
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.006
it has been trained on,

25
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:11.005
but in a newly structured context-based form.

26
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:14.008
No doubt, it does it surprisingly well.

27
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.009
Alongside the best results it can produce,

28
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.003
the worst of humanity can also be delivered,

29
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.007
output that is biased, stereotypical,

30
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.008
wrong, offensive, explicit, nonsensical,

31
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:31.007
excessively long or way too short,

32
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:35.001
and similar are all possible.

33
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:39.004
One type of problematic output is when it is simply made up.

34
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.005
It's not based on any facts.

35
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:43.009
Called an AI hallucination,

36
00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.003
GPT will sometimes produce an answer

37
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.003
that is simply not true.

38
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.005
AI doesn't have what we call common sense.

39
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:55.002
You can quickly see how that can present an issue.

40
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.000
An added limitation is that GPT

41
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.007
doesn't provide a list of data

42
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.008
and information sources for its output.

43
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:05.003
This can create issues that include copyright challenges,

44
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:08.007
source validation, academic accuracy,

45
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:11.000
and providing references.

46
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.002
If that's important to you,

47
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.006
I suggest adding that requirement to a prompt

48
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:18.007
or asking for references as a prompt follow-up.

49
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:21.003
GPT is optimized for both the English language

50
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.003
and often exhibits a Western perspective.

51
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:25.007
Other languages and cultures

52
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:27.007
are not yet being fully reflected,

53
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:32.002
creating problematic sensitivity and bias issues.

54
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.007
These challenges are improved through training

55
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:37.005
but can also be made worse through training.

56
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:40.000
In addition, OpenAI works continuously

57
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.005
to put in place guardrails

58
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:45.005
to limit the possibility of inappropriate responses.

59
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.005
However, this may inadvertently restrict answers

60
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:52.005
and by extension create bias and censorship concerns.

61
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:57.004
OpenAI does prohibit certain uses with GPT and ChatGPT.

62
00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:00.009
Their usage policy can be found at the link on the screen.

63
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.009
Prohibitions include illegal activities,

64
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.006
generation of hateful, harassing and violent content,

65
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:12.002
creation of malware or use in weapons development.

66
00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:15.007
The model relies heavily on how the prompt is constructed.

67
00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:18.002
For example, one prompt may result in no answer,

68
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:21.002
while a small tweak can deliver a full answer.

69
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:22.002
This means results

70
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.006
can sometimes be too dependent on the user

71
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.002
rather than the software.

72
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:28.003
GPT's inclination is towards

73
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:30.004
answering the prompt on the first try

74
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:34.002
rather than seeking clarification if it's required.

75
00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:36.004
At the time of creating this course,

76
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:40.004
GPT-4 content was current to September, 2021.

77
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:43.001
As a result, no answers are provided by the system

78
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.009
for requests that reference anything after that date.

79
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.004
Obviously, this includes no existing capability

80
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:52.005
to refresh content near real time.

81
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:54.006
Additionally, in a related limitation,

82
00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:57.007
model tuning is not yet permitted by the user.

83
00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.007
For example, a scientist may want the model

84
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:01.006
to support a niche medical area

85
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.008
that is not part of GPT corpus.

86
00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:07.006
I can't imagine these limitations being around too long.

87
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:11.001
In this video, I've largely focused on technical issues.

88
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.001
It's my view that we'll overcome many of these and others

89
00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:16.006
that may emerge in the months and years ahead.

90
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:19.003
Of course, it's vital to understand these limitations

91
00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:21.007
as you consider the application of GPT

92
00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:24.000
in your work and organization.

93
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.008
That said, in addition to these issues,

94
00:04:26.008 --> 00:04:29.007
there are many non-technical challenges and risks

95
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:32.009
that we will also need to understand and overcome.

96
00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.004
I discuss those in the next video.
