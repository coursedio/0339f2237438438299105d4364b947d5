00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.000
- Not withstanding some limitations.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.008
If you've used ChatGPT recently,

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.007
it doesn't fail to impress.

4
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:12.000
Similarly, as more applications integrate GPT capabilities,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.009
the results are often remarkable.

6
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.001
For example, a solution such as room GPT

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.005
takes input of a photo of a room and almost instantly

8
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.003
produces output of the room redesigned.

9
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.004
What used to take interior designers years

10
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:27.005
of training and hours

11
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:31.009
of time to produce is now created in seconds.

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.005
In just months, thousands

13
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:36.009
of new solutions have emerged that automate

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.002
and reinvent how we do all matter of things.

15
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.000
Every day more emerge, placing a heavy burden

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.005
on the status quo.

17
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.004
If this is the impact and response we're experiencing now,

18
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.007
what will the world of AI look like

19
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:55.001
in just 18 or 24 months from now?

20
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.006
It's both an exhilarating and daunting thought.

21
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.009
While we can expect more groundbreaking innovation

22
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.001
that will be useful, embraced by many,

23
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.002
we'll also see more tension being paid

24
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.005
to areas such as regulation

25
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.005
and perhaps some form of global collaboration

26
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:17.002
to manage risks to economies, society, and humanity overall.

27
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.001
It's going to be a tumultuous time.

28
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.006
There are many aspects to consider on a continuum.

29
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:28.000
On one end, part of society believes AI is fairly benign

30
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.003
and will positively support humans much as technology has

31
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:32.004
in the past.

32
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.008
While on the other extreme end, people believe

33
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:39.001
AI presents an existential threat to humanity.

34
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.003
I think you'll agree there's a big range between

35
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:45.005
these two perspectives and what they mean for the future.

36
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.000
It's a safe bet to assume that both the capabilities,

37
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.001
challenges, and responses to AI will heat up

38
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.004
in the months ahead, each serving up generous amounts

39
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.004
of uncertainty.

40
00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:00.001
For you and I and the organizations we work with,

41
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:05.001
it's a time for education, experimentation, investment,

42
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.005
and risk management.

43
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.004
There's an enormous amount of value that AI is bringing

44
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:12.009
to augment all types of work.

45
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.007
No matter the industry, AI will have an impact.

46
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:18.009
For example, we should see accelerated progress

47
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:23.006
in areas such as medicine, agriculture, sustainability,

48
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.004
and autonomous transportation.

49
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:29.003
Keep closely apprised on such developments relevant

50
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.007
to your industry.

51
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.006
I created this short video course to introduce the basics

52
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:36.006
of AI and GPT.

53
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.007
It's just the start.

54
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.005
For next steps, I recommend checking out

55
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.007
my highly popular Foundations

56
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.006
of the Fourth Industrial Revolution course.

57
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.002
This will help to put AI and other trends

58
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.004
into a broader perspective for you.

59
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.008
Next, you could check out many of the wonderful AI courses

60
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:57.008
on LinkedIn learning by other authors.

61
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:00.006
They cover just about every aspect of the topic

62
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:03.007
from prompt engineering to coding.

63
00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:07.008
Now, as we come to the end, let me ask you a question.

64
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:09.001
Is it possible that some part

65
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.007
of this video course was written by GPT?

66
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:13.009
And more importantly,

67
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.009
would it make a difference if you knew?

68
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:21.004
With that, I wish you continued success with your goals.

69
00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:24.002
Thank you for watching and good luck.
