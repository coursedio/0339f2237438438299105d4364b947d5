00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Presenter] With artificial intelligence

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:03.008
suddenly getting so much attention

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.009
and having such a big impact across industries,

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.008
it's worth understanding how it came about.

5
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.002
Is AI something completely new

6
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.008
or has it existed for years or even decades?

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.007
Let's start with the definition.

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.008
I like this one from Merriam-Webster Dictionary:

9
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.000
AI is the capability of a machine

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to imitate intelligent human behavior.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.003
Most other definitions are a variation of this.

12
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:35.001
The idea that human activities can be simulated by a machine

13
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.006
is the core of AI research and development.

14
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.005
What may be a surprise to many

15
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.000
is that AI has been an area of interest

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.009
and progress since the 1950s,

17
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.006
but another way, scientists, engineers, mathematicians,

18
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:53.007
and others have been working on it for almost 70 years.

19
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:57.007
Early uses of AI included basic assembly line robotics,

20
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.007
chatbots, decision support tools,

21
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:04.001
and expert systems for problem solving.

22
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.003
In recent years,

23
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.008
improved computing performance and networks,

24
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.009
software languages and operating systems,

25
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.003
algorithms and big data have all contributed

26
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:18.003
to an acceleration in AI capability.

27
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.000
Popular culture would have us imagine AI

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.002
in the form of sentient entities

29
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.001
such as C-3PO in "Star Wars"

30
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:30.009
or HAL 9000 in "2001: A Space Odyssey."

31
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.001
In reality, AI is software that is often found

32
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.001
in enterprise applications and embedded in devices

33
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.002
from our smartphones to dishwashers,

34
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:44.002
okay, and the occasional human-looking robot.

35
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:47.004
While AI, at some level, can appear magical,

36
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.008
what we're actually experiencing is software

37
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.002
that performs a particular set of tasks well.

38
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:56.004
Given that today's common AI uses are specialized

39
00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:58.009
and not general purpose just yet,

40
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.001
it's appropriately described as narrow AI.

41
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.008
While we say AI, what we're really describing

42
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:09.005
is artificial narrow intelligence or ANI.

43
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:13.002
Narrow AI differs from other forms of AI research

44
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:17.002
such as artificial general intelligence, AGI,

45
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.007
or artificial super intelligence, ASI,

46
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:24.000
which are in the category of strong intelligence.

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.007
This category focuses on the ability for a computer

48
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:29.009
to perform tasks through reasoning and thinking,

49
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.008
emulating and surpassing the intelligence of humans.

50
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:36.001
Ultimately, the software may have emotion

51
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.007
and self-awareness,

52
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:40.005
although don't expect any announcements on that

53
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:43.001
for some time to come.

54
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.006
Today's narrow AI takes existing data, the more the better,

55
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.004
and uses statistical techniques to help it learn

56
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:54.006
how to become progressively better at a specific task.

57
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:57.009
This approach is called machine learning or ML.

58
00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.005
It's great at performing activities

59
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.006
such as returning results in online search,

60
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:05.002
image recognition such as identifying an object

61
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:07.000
in a digital photograph,

62
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
recognizing our voice commands made to Siri and Alexa,

63
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.004
and enabling self-driving cars to avoid collisions.

64
00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:17.004
A subset of ML called deep learning

65
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:20.002
or DL uses advanced algorithms

66
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.002
and lots of data to support the concept

67
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.005
of learning by example.

68
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:27.000
For example, show a deep learning program

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.001
many pictures of bicycles

70
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.005
and it will soon predict with good accuracy

71
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:35.003
whether a bicycle is in a picture presented to it.

72
00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:38.002
Today, AI research and applications are expanding

73
00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:41.001
to include areas such as problem solving,

74
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:46.004
natural language processing and generation, NLP and NLG,

75
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:50.002
perception, planning, and robotics.

76
00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:53.000
Despite how remarkable AI appears today,

77
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.002
it's important to recognize

78
00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:58.004
that we're in the relatively early stages of its potential.

79
00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.004
In the months and years ahead,

80
00:04:00.004 --> 00:04:03.009
and as you'll see, particularly with the emergence of GPT,

81
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:08.002
its real impact is only beginning to be felt at large.

82
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:10.007
The biggest challenges of AI in the future

83
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:12.006
may not be the technology,

84
00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:14.005
but questions that evolve areas

85
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:18.005
such as ethics, philosophy, culture,

86
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:22.004
regulation, politics, and economics.

87
00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:26.007
We'll touch briefly on some of these areas in later videos.

88
00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:29.007
Let's now continue to tell the story of AI

89
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:32.009
as we next visit the origins of OpenAI,

90
00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.007
the organization that built and launched GPT.
