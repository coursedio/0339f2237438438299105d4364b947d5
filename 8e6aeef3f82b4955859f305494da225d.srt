1
00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.002
- To understand what motivated the formation of OpenAI,

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.003
the San Francisco based company behind GPT,

3
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:11.002
requires a brief discussion on an ongoing core debate

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.005
within the AI community.

5
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.008
This debate asks whether advances in AI present,

6
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.004
on one side of the argument,

7
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.007
a better, more prosperous future,

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:25.001
or on the other side, a future where AI is to be feared.

9
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.009
Those who say AI is a positive force,

10
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.006
such as Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor and futurist,

11
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:35.002
argues that it will free up humans for more leisure time

12
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.005
and enable more of us to focus on creative pursuits.

13
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.007
Those on the other concerned side of the argument,

14
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:45.009
such as Bill Gates, the former CEO of Microsoft,

15
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:50.003
worry that AI, while remarkable, may be dangerous.

16
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:53.007
He fears, for example, AI being applied in warfare

17
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:57.002
to manage autonomous weapons, those that search for

18
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:01.007
and destroy targets without human intervention.

19
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:05.006
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter,

20
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.006
has been outspoken about his concerns.

21
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.008
He shares views similar to the late Stephen Hawking,

22
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:16.000
the notable theoretical physicist and cosmologist.

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.008
They have characterized some form of future AI

24
00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:23.004
as potentially humanity's "greatest existential threat,"

25
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:26.007
a concerning view indeed.

26
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.006
Responding to this concern, in October, 2015,

27
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.005
Elon Musk along with Sam Altman,

28
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.000
former president of startup accelerator Y Combinator,

29
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.001
and other investors

30
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.009
such as co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman

31
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.003
and Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, created OpenAI.

32
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.003
Corporations such as Microsoft, who recently,

33
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:52.006
significantly increased its investment in OpenAI,

34
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:57.003
and Infosys were also founding members.

35
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:01.002
Acknowledging their concerns about the risks of future AI,

36
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:05.003
they committed to actions that could prevent major risks.

37
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:09.005
These partners formed OpenAI in the spirit of promoting

38
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:14.001
and developing AI in a manner that would benefit humanity.

39
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.009
To demonstrate their commitment,

40
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.001
together they pledged over $1 billion

41
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:21.004
to create the organization.

42
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.003
Their mission was clear.

43
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:26.006
OpenAI would be focused on ensuring that the development

44
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:29.007
and usage of Artficial General Intelligence,

45
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:33.001
or AGI, would benefit the world.

46
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.002
They would build safe AGI

47
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:37.003
and consider their mission successful

48
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:41.001
if it helped others achieve the same outcome.

49
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.005
The organization began as a nonprofit

50
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:47.003
in early 2016 with nine researchers.

51
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:48.007
By April of that year,

52
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:52.008
they released their first product called OpenAI Gym.

53
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:54.005
This was a toolkit for developing

54
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:58.004
and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

55
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:01.007
Reinforcement learning is when a computer employs trial

56
00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:06.000
and error to come up with a solution to a problem.

57
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.008
In December, 2016, OpenAI released Universe.

58
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.006
This was a platform for enabling AI software

59
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:15.005
to interact with a computer,

60
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:17.003
such as viewing what's on the screen

61
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:20.001
and using a virtual keyboard and mouse.

62
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:22.006
These solutions were followed by several more

63
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.006
in the machine learning space.

64
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:31.003
In 2018, OpenAI published a paper on Generative Pre-Training

65
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:33.007
and what would soon become the first version

66
00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:36.004
of GPT software.

67
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:40.008
At first, much of the code behind OpenAI was open source,

68
00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:44.000
thus the use of the term "Open" in its name,

69
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.009
enabling others to inspect, modify,

70
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.006
and distribute the code for their purposes.

71
00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:51.009
Transparency and sharing were consistent

72
00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.007
with the organization's founding mission.

73
00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:57.009
However, as with so many initial intentions,

74
00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:02.000
strategy can often change in response to market conditions,

75
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.005
leadership, philosophy, and opportunity.

76
00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:12.003
In 2019, OpenAI dropped its designation as a pure nonprofit

77
00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:15.001
and became a for-profit enterprise.

78
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:17.001
This was done for a variety of reasons

79
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:20.007
that included the ability to attract further investment

80
00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:23.009
through monetization opportunities.

81
00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.002
Microsoft stepped forward and became a significant investor.

82
00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:32.001
Further, Microsoft became OpenAI's preferred partner

83
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:34.008
to license its technology and integrate it

84
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:39.000
into their existing and future products and services.

85
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.001
In addition, Elon Musk resigned from his board seat.

86
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.006
He cited a potential conflict of interest

87
00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.009
with the work at Tesla in developing AI

88
00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.001
for self-driving cars, as well as his concerns

89
00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:53.005
about the new for-profit direction.

90
00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:58.007
With the massive success of ChatGPT and GPT-4,

91
00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:02.008
OpenAI is pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

92
00:05:02.008 --> 00:05:04.006
It's becoming clear already

93
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:08.006
that OpenAI's competition will be rigorous

94
00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:13.003
and the future incredibly unpredictable for all of us.
