00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.008
- For thousands of years, humans have been using all manner

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:07.006
of complex tools to assist in their daily activities.

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.007
It's what separates us

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.005
from most of the rest of the animal kingdom.

5
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.007
Augmenting our work has largely been welcomed.

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.003
Over time our tools have become

7
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.002
vastly more elaborate and helpful.

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.007
Without machines, for example,

9
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.007
the Industrial Revolutions would've been impossible,

10
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.008
and the world we know today would not exist.

11
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.008
Directly and indirectly, advancements in these tools

12
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.005
and machines have resulted in the elevation

13
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:36.000
of billions of people out of extreme poverty.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.007
Today, with a combination

15
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:41.002
of robotics and artificial intelligence, or AI,

16
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.008
smart machines are designing, developing,

17
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:48.004
and deploying solutions with much less input from humans.

18
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:52.002
AI-enabled capabilities powered by game-changing software

19
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:55.008
and vast amounts of data are demonstrating familiar

20
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:59.008
and convincing human behaviors, such as making things,

21
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:03.005
problem-solving, and pattern recognition.

22
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.006
There are few places where AI is more apparent today

23
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.003
than in our factories and offices.

24
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.000
Enterprise applications are increasingly being powered

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
by AI-enabled software.

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.008
We see use of this software in areas such as cybersecurity,

27
00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:23.001
financial forecasting, engineering, coding, design,

28
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.002
and in product lifecycle and supply chain management.

29
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:31.004
New AI capabilities are being introduced all the time.

30
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:36.001
However, sometimes there is a sudden leap in innovation.

31
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:40.000
In 2018, one such event happened.

32
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.006
GPT version one was released.

33
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:48.000
GPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer,

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.009
was created by OpenAI,

35
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.006
a San Francisco based research laboratory.

36
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:58.000
GPT, and specifically its solution called ChatGPT,

37
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.008
released in November 2022,

38
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:03.001
would introduce the existing concept

39
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:07.001
of generative AI to the broader world.

40
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.005
This is software that takes input provided

41
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:13.008
by a person or machine and creates remarkable output

42
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:18.006
in the form of text, audio, and visuals.

43
00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:20.006
Since its release in 2018,

44
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.007
several new versions of GPT have been introduced,

45
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:27.004
expanding and improving what it can deliver.

46
00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:30.000
Today, there is a scramble to embed GPT

47
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.005
and related generative AI capabilities

48
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:35.000
into all types of existing solutions

49
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.005
and to create completely new solutions.

50
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:41.002
This course covers GPT in general,

51
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.007
but with version four as the basis

52
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:48.001
for the capabilities explored and examples provided.

53
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.003
Before I jump deep into GPT, let's first step back

54
00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:55.001
and briefly understand the AI journey

55
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.002
that has taken us to where we are today.
