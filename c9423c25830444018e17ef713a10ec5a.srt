00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.007
- While the important debate

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.006
over the potential negative impacts

3
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.005
of AI on existing jobs continues,

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.004
let's also recognize

5
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.006
that in every technological and societal shift,

6
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.000
there are also plenty of winners.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.007
Each of the previous industrial revolutions

8
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.008
made many jobs and businesses obsolete,

9
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:22.005
but they also generated completely new work and industries

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.009
that more often generated better economics

11
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.000
than those they replaced.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.005
Sure, AI is anticipated to eliminate a lot of work,

13
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.009
but it's important that we don't lose sight of the fact

14
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.009
that new lucrative AI careers and business opportunities

15
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.009
will also emerge in the years ahead.

16
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.000
Any discussion on the future of AI

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.006
must include the jobs and careers it will create

18
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:49.001
and the ways it will augment the way many work.

19
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.004
By transforming what and how work is delivered,

20
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:55.004
according to the consulting firm, McKinsey,

21
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.004
AI is projected to contribute $13 trillion

22
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:01.003
to the global economy by 2030.

23
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.005
The World Economic Forum is on record

24
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:09.009
predicting that AI will create 97 million new jobs by 2025.

25
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.008
Looking just at generative AI, the realm of GPT,

26
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.007
a Goldman Sachs study suggests it could produce

27
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:22.009
a $7 trillion increase in global GDP by the early 2030s.

28
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.007
These numbers, of course, can vary

29
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.002
depending on how we define the scope of AI.

30
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:32.001
Should we include robots in our definition, for example?

31
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:33.007
Broadly though, much of the value

32
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.001
that AI will bring over the next few years

33
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.003
can be distilled into three major buckets:

34
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.007
improved customer experiences,

35
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:45.009
new revenue opportunities, and cost reductions.

36
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.009
Consider for a moment

37
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.001
a few of the different types of new AI-centric businesses

38
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:54.003
and jobs that may be created to support these areas.

39
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.004
Equally important too is to evaluate

40
00:01:56.004 --> 00:02:00.006
what roles these efforts might displace.

41
00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:04.000
Today, most organizations recognize the role of technology,

42
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.006
and particularly digitalization as a core mechanism

43
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.004
for achieving these strategic objectives.

44
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.006
The ongoing digital transformation of the global economy

45
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:17.009
will continue to drive demand in technology-related jobs.

46
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:21.008
AI-specific work may require more technical education

47
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:24.001
and specialization.

48
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.001
The need for data-focused jobs,

49
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:30.002
given the intersection between AI and digitalization,

50
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:32.007
will also continue to increase.

51
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:36.008
According to CompTIA, a leading technology association,

52
00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:40.006
the top five AI skills for IT professionals

53
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.009
include support and troubleshooting of AI issues,

54
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.005
AI algorithm development,

55
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:48.007
software development in general,

56
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:52.007
cybersecurity, and data analysis.

57
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:54.008
And what about generative AI?

58
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:57.006
This area is creating a demand for roles

59
00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:59.004
that include prompt engineers,

60
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:02.004
the role that specializes in creating the best input

61
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:04.004
for a GPT.

62
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:06.009
All types of data-related roles,

63
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.008
AI product owners, AI trainers.

64
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.005
These are for training AI, not people.

65
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.005
Lots of backend technical engineering roles,

66
00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:20.004
science and research work, and analysts.

67
00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:22.008
What will surprise us all in the future

68
00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:24.007
will be the essential roles

69
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:27.006
that we can't even imagine right now.

70
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.006
In an environment of work disruption

71
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.001
and future career uncertainty,

72
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.003
at least in the short to medium term,

73
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:35.009
if you're thoughtful and strategic

74
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.007
about your skills development,

75
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:39.009
there will be opportunities.

76
00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:43.002
If you're inclined towards a role in the world of AI,

77
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:46.002
demand will be high for some time to come,

78
00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:49.009
and completely new work will emerge.

79
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:54.007
Stay informed, be proactive, and remain optimistic.
