- Artificial intelligence is now creating

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:06.000
compelling text and visual content.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.005
This content is of such high quality,

4
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:12.004
it's hard to differentiate it from that created by a person.

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.008
Called generative AI, it's enabling

6
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:16.005
remarkable new capabilities

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:19.008
for individuals and organizations.

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.002
Hi, I'm Dr. Jonathan Reichental,

9
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.009
business owner, professor, and author.

10
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.007
Let me take you on a brief journey

11
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.000
to introduce the basics of AI

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.007
and a version of generative AI called GPT.

13
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.004
Now is the time to understand the opportunities,

14
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.008
limitations, and risks presented by this new technology.

15
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:43.002
This course will provide you with a solid foundation

16
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.008
and I'm confident it will inspire you to learn more.

17
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.007
Okay, let's do this.
